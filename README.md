This repository demonstrates a common error in Swift's async/await: forgetting to handle errors properly.  The `bug.swift` file shows the incorrect code, which fails to catch potential errors during network operations, while `bugSolution.swift` provides the correct implementation.  Proper error handling is crucial to prevent unexpected crashes and improve the robustness of your application.  This example highlights the importance of using `try await` within an appropriate `do-catch` block to manage potential errors.
